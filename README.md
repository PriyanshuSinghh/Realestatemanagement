 Real Estate Management System  The Real Estate Management System is a comprehensive project designed to automate and streamline property management, tenant handling, lease agreements, payments, and maintenance requests. Built using SQL, this system provides an efficient way for landlords, property managers, and tenants to interact and manage rental properties, ensuring a smooth and organized process.  Key Features: Property Management: The system enables property owners or managers to register and manage their properties. Each property record includes essential details such as address, type (Apartment, House, Condo, etc.), rent amount, availability status, and the owner's name. This feature ensures landlords can maintain up-to-date information about their available and rented properties.  Tenant Management: The system stores detailed tenant information, including name, contact details, email, and date of birth. Tenants are linked to the properties they rent, which allows property managers to keep track of tenant history and rent payments. This is essential for efficient tenant communication and management.  Lease Management: The lease functionality in this system allows landlords to manage lease agreements, including lease start and end dates, rent amounts, and lease status (Active, Completed, Terminated). This feature provides landlords with a clear view of ongoing and upcoming lease terms, ensuring timely renewals or terminations.  Payment Tracking: The system tracks payments made by tenants, including payment methods (Credit Card, Bank Transfer, etc.), amounts, and dates. This helps property managers and landlords easily monitor payment statuses and identify any overdue payments or payment discrepancies.  Maintenance Requests: Tenants can report maintenance issues such as plumbing problems, broken appliances, or electrical faults. These requests are tracked in the system, with statuses indicating whether the issue is pending, in progress, or resolved. This feature helps improve tenant satisfaction by ensuring quick resolution of property-related issues.  The Real Estate Management System provides a structured and efficient solution for property managers, landlords, and tenants. This project demonstrates practical knowledge of relational databases, SQL, and efficient data management, making it an excellent addition to any developerâ€™s portfolio.
