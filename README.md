# Real Estate Management System

## Description

The Real Estate Management System is a comprehensive project built using SQL that helps manage property listings, tenants, leases, payments, and maintenance requests. It aims to simplify and automate the management of rental properties, making it easier for landlords and property managers to maintain an organized system for managing their properties and tenants.

### Key Features:

- **Property Management**: Register and manage properties, including address, type (Apartment, House, etc.), rent amount, and availability status.
- **Tenant Management**: Store and manage tenant information, including their name, contact details, email, and associated property.
- **Lease Management**: Track lease agreements, including lease start/end dates, rent amounts, and lease statuses (Active, Completed, Terminated).
- **Payment Tracking**: Record and monitor tenant payments, including payment dates, methods (Credit Card, Bank Transfer, etc.), and amounts.
- **Maintenance Requests**: Tenants can submit maintenance issues for their properties, and the system tracks their status (Pending, In Progress, Resolved).

## Database Schema

The database includes the following tables:

- **Properties**: Stores information about properties available for rent.
- **Tenants**: Stores details about tenants renting properties.
- **Leases**: Links tenants with properties and tracks lease terms.
- **Payments**: Records payments made by tenants for their leases.
- **MaintenanceRequests**: Tracks maintenance issues reported by tenants for their rented properties.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: For managing database and relationships between tables.
- **Database Systems**: Compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any relational database.
